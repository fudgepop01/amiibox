# Amiibox

## What it is

Amiibox is a full-featured editor for amiibo developed by fudgepop01.
It's extremely dynamic - all of the regions can be modified through a simple text file.

## Development

Clone the repo then use `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
Once that's done, use `npm run build` to build it, or `npm run dev` to develop it.
Open another terminal window and use `npm run start` to actually start the application.

## Building

use `npm run dist` to package the application for distribution. This will appear in the `/dist` folder.
